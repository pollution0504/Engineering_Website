            This week was boring. I had a lot of hw and I procrastinated most of it until it was actually time for class. I was the judge for the CAD contest and the winner was a really complicated toaster made by someone talented. I

            The queen died today. We worked on a rube goldberg machine with our new groups. Honestly I'm not so sure if this will work but oh well. I get splatoon 3 tomorrow so I'm excited for that!

            IM JOINING A SMASH TEAM!! maybe i can go pro >:) well im not necessarily in a team yet. but im praying on my knees. Mr poole is honestly one of my favorite teachers, he's nice chill and funny. I remember in the past, i saw him and thought that he was a senior. I also dissected a computer with Tigran, and it seems like Mr. Poole liked how I looked cuz theres 20 photos of me :D.

            We spent the last two weeks cadding, making, and launching bottle rockets. First we had to draw out our ideas on a piece of paper, then we cadded our ideas, then we put our ideas into a real life prototype. If i remember correctly, no rockets made any real distance, but it was still a fun experience. Otherwise,

            We are learning Electrical Engineering for this month. The concepts were a bit difficult in the beginning but I think I understand it now. Falcon Team B is completely out the tourney. Bro these guys in the back are literally bullying ppl, i feel bad but i don't wanna be involved. making fun of ppl's accent, armenian slurs, and just bein hella loud and annoying. If they weren't in this class it would be so fun. Here is some screenshots showing my breadboards. I have to get used to all of the formulas with ohms, volts, current, etc.

            If im being honest I can't comprehend electrical engineering but at least I got a cool partner who isn't either a complete nerd or a dumbahh. This week we did actual electrical engineering, using physical breadboards, LEDs, and wires to make lights and shi. Mr. Poole, you are a munch. If our love was tragedy why are you my remedy.
