            This week was boring. I had a lot of hw and I procrastinated most of it until it was actually time for class. I was the judge for the CAD contest and the winner was a really complicated toaster made by someone talented. I
            m on lab #10 for ap and my rube goldberg machine is coming together, i'm just struggling on how i will actually make it.

            The queen died today. We worked on a rube goldberg machine with our new groups. Honestly I'm not so sure if this will work but oh well. I get splatoon 3 tomorrow so I'm excited for that!

            This week was such an uneventful week. I built the trident boat and met cool ppl while doing that. Also me dego nark and sunny got to work on making the rube goldberg machine. I had to spend so much money at walgreens just to get pringles cans :(. <a href="./PaperBoat.pdf">PaperBoatWorksheet!!</a>

            Mr poole got covid !! rip poole. He violated everyone with the pictures he took of everyone. Last minute we had to whip up a crappy rube goldberg machine, we had to stay after class because we couldn't pop the balloon.

            Dear Mr. Poole, I hope you are doing okay during these sad covid times. I finished the prosthetic for the Elephant, it's an okay looking thing ngl.

            IM JOINING A SMASH TEAM!! maybe i can go pro >:) well im not necessarily in a team yet. but im praying on my knees. Mr poole is honestly one of my favorite teachers, he's nice chill and funny. I remember in the past, i saw him and thought that he was a senior. I also dissected a computer with Tigran, and it seems like Mr. Poole liked how I looked cuz theres 20 photos of me :D.

            We spent the last two weeks cadding, making, and launching bottle rockets. First we had to draw out our ideas on a piece of paper, then we cadded our ideas, then we put our ideas into a real life prototype. If i remember correctly, no rockets made any real distance, but it was still a fun experience. Otherwise,

            We are learning Electrical Engineering for this month. The concepts were a bit difficult in the beginning but I think I understand it now. Falcon Team B is completely out the tourney. Bro these guys in the back are literally bullying ppl, i feel bad but i don't wanna be involved. making fun of ppl's accent, armenian slurs, and just bein hella loud and annoying. If they weren't in this class it would be so fun. Here is some screenshots showing my breadboards. I have to get used to all of the formulas with ohms, volts, current, etc.

            If im being honest I can't comprehend electrical engineering but at least I got a cool partner who isn't either a complete nerd or a dumbahh. This week we did actual electrical engineering, using physical breadboards, LEDs, and wires to make lights and shi. Mr. Poole, you are a munch.

            I feel tired and I got a cold yesterday =(, this week we started to code using arduino IDE and I wish we explored arduinos more but I don't think we will be able to do that. Using the code we were able to turn on multiple lights at a time, and even create patterns. I have no clue what my plans for thanksgiving break are. I only have footage of LAB 3 + 4 but better.

            Me and my team are going to build a spaghetti bridge that can hold a bucket filled with water. I took the liberty of doing most of the project so far by sketching an example on cardboard. istg some of these ppl in my group dont do shat. i figured that we didn't need a full on road to hold any toy cars, just one line of a bunch of spaghetti to hold up the carabiner thats holding the bucket of water. Lately I've wanted to just let my team try to do some work, see how far they would go.

            Today when I went to 7th period to test our bridge, it snapped in half. Some parts of the woodglue weren't on the tissue paper, so we had to scrape it out gently from the cardboard. It broke that part anyways. Also, since the weight distribution was mostly in the middle, it snapped through the middle when i tried to do a minor stress test.

            Sadly I was not here to see how the bridges worked, but I heard that all of the bridges didn't do so well. During the winter break, I got my driver's license, and I slept for sooo long. I even forgot if it was sunday or wednesday, I completely forgot. This week is Business Engineering, and we are learning how to pitch our own project. I was paired with Diego and we developed a new idea called "StarSleeper". A rocket ship bed made for children, teens, and is able to be monitered by parents/guardians. By understanding our own strengths and weaknesses, and by believing in ourselves and our product, I believe we could do a perfect pitch
