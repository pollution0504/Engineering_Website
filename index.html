            This week was boring. I had a lot of hw and I procrastinated most of it until it was actually time for class. I was the judge for the CAD contest and the winner was a really complicated toaster made by someone talented. I
            m on lab #10 for ap and my rube goldberg machine is coming together, i'm just struggling on how i will actually make it.

            The queen died today. We worked on a rube goldberg machine with our new groups. Honestly I'm not so sure if this will work but oh well. I get splatoon 3 tomorrow so I'm excited for that!

            This week was such an uneventful week. I built the trident boat and met cool ppl while doing that. Also me dego nark and sunny got to work on making the rube goldberg machine. I had to spend so much money at walgreens just to get pringles cans :(. <a href="./PaperBoat.pdf">PaperBoatWorksheet!!</a>

            IM JOINING A SMASH TEAM!! maybe i can go pro >:) well im not necessarily in a team yet. but im praying on my knees. Mr poole is honestly one of my favorite teachers, he's nice chill and funny. I remember in the past, i saw him and thought that he was a senior. I also dissected a computer with Tigran, and it seems like Mr. Poole liked how I looked cuz theres 20 photos of me :D.

            We spent the last two weeks cadding, making, and launching bottle rockets. First we had to draw out our ideas on a piece of paper, then we cadded our ideas, then we put our ideas into a real life prototype. If i remember correctly, no rockets made any real distance, but it was still a fun experience. Otherwise,

            We are learning Electrical Engineering for this month. The concepts were a bit difficult in the beginning but I think I understand it now. Falcon Team B is completely out the tourney. Bro these guys in the back are literally bullying ppl, i feel bad but i don't wanna be involved. making fun of ppl's accent, armenian slurs, and just bein hella loud and annoying. If they weren't in this class it would be so fun. Here is some screenshots showing my breadboards. I have to get used to all of the formulas with ohms, volts, current, etc.

            I feel tired and I got a cold yesterday =(, this week we started to code using arduino IDE and I wish we explored arduinos more but I don't think we will be able to do that. Using the code we were able to turn on multiple lights at a time, and even create patterns. I have no clue what my plans for thanksgiving break are. I only have footage of LAB 3 + 4 but better.

            Me and my team are going to build a spaghetti bridge that can hold a bucket filled with water. I took the liberty of doing most of the project so far by sketching an example on cardboard. istg some of these ppl in my group dont do shat. i figured that we didn't need a full on road to hold any toy cars, just one line of a bunch of spaghetti to hold up the carabiner thats holding the bucket of water. Lately I've wanted to just let my team try to do some work, see how far they would go.

            Today when I went to 7th period to test our bridge, it snapped in half. Some parts of the woodglue weren't on the tissue paper, so we had to scrape it out gently from the cardboard. It broke that part anyways. Also, since the weight distribution was mostly in the middle, it snapped through the middle when i tried to do a minor stress test.

            Sadly I was not here to see how the bridges worked, but I heard that all of the bridges didn't do so well. During the winter break, I got my driver's license, and I slept for sooo long. I even forgot if it was sunday or wednesday, I completely forgot. This week is Business Engineering, and we are learning how to pitch our own project. I was paired with Diego and we developed a new idea called "StarSleeper". A rocket ship bed made for children, teens, and is able to be monitered by parents/guardians. By understanding our own strengths and weaknesses, and by believing in ourselves and our product, I believe we could do a perfect pitch

            This week we presented our ideas to eachother, and I came to the realization that it really didn't matter about the product at hand, all you had to do is wait for them to outbid eachother, and then pick the best offer. We picked rohan because no one else did. I learned how to make shark-tank like offers, and how to accurately assume what someones net worth is.

            This week we learned about chemical engineering for the first part of the week. Me and my partner Diego made oobleck, a non-newtonian fluid made out of pure cornstarch and water. Even though it has nothing to do with, we tried to make a house of cards. I don't understand why we would do that challenge, other than to demonstrate either physics or patience. On wednesday, a big project got released, where me and Dhruv try to make an rc car with arduino code. We had to make a 5 page proposal to Mr. Poole proposing the idea of our car. We wanted to try and make the frame out of legos. During the week, me and dhruv went on calls afterschool to discuss what to put on the proposal, as well as updating our bom's, and our tinkercads.

            This week we started to work on our arduino car. We did more research on our arduino car. We looked into diffrent components to use on our car and how it works. We learned that we couldn't use the motor sheild because it takes up all the pins so that we found a smaller motor controller that we will use so that we can still hook up the leds we wanted originally to use as blinkers and headlights on the car. This weeks challenge day was to make the longest post-it-note bridge. We were only allowed 15 sticky notes which we cut up into 1/4 pieces to spread out the bridge and lessen the weight. If i remember we got around 120 in. The winners made a bridge that was about 140 inches.

            This week we continued to work on me and Dhruv's Arduino car. I have developed some code that will let us use led's coming from the arduino board to act as brake lights and led blinkers. Although we were ready to test the motors, and come up with a hypothesis on how they work, we weren't able to get our hands on the motor shield we wanted. However, Mr. Poole reminded us that next week we will be able to use both the Motor Controller we need and an optional Bluetooth module (HC-05). Hopefully, we are going to get a 3D-printed frame for a Tesla truck from Diego. Thursday was a challenge day, and it was fun to make a contraption using various objects such as rubber bands, meters, and sticks. We had to use these to get a water balloon to fall onto the court.

            This week me and Dhruv continued to work on our Arduino car. Specifically, we learned how to solder our motors to wires. Even though we didn't have school this friday, we still were very productive. Initially there was some trouble with the scripts and where to place the wires for the motors, but we realized that we needed to put them on opposite ports, one into power, and one into ground. Although they did start moving, we had to kickstart the motors, which is a big problem. I suggested that we make our prototype smaller to be still able to fit all of our parts, but to more or less lessen the weight of the vehicle. So we will guarenteed work on that next week. Also, I have coded it so that the brake lights will turn on when the car is either moving backwards or stopped completely. Speaking of, I created a sort of kill-switch upon Dhruvs request, but I didn't want to call it "Kill-Switch", so I renamed it to "Parking". At the same time that we fixed all of this, we figured that it would make sense to put in functional led front headlights, and code those towards moving foward and when turning left or right.

            This week is Arduino week 5, where we run into more problems. I thought that being given the wrong motor controller to work with in the beginning was a difficult hurdle, but it turns out that we had a torque problem as well. Luckily, Mr Poole kinda baby fed the answer to us, which was that we never plugged in the battery, in fear that we would overload the breadboard or the arduino. So after plugging in the 9V, it went CRAZY fast. Me and Dhruv were astonished to see our creation essentialy fly out. I shortened the code, and made it more intuitive for Mr. Poole and others to come see. That's all for this week! :)

            This is last week for our Arduino cars, and I'm so done with this project. In the end, Dhruv pushed for lego parts instead of the amazing Ford F-150 I made, so we ended up with a lego contraption with 2 days left to complete it. Sadly, no one was able to figure out how to do the Bluetooth module, including Mr. Poole,

            This week and last week we were assigned / got to make groups for boat building. I heard that this was technically the final :(. I'm with chris, diego, and dhruv to make the best boat we can. At first, me and diego were researching what winning boats look like.

            This week we continued to build the boats. I hate raining days, and especially yesterday, I had to carry a bunch of cardboard for this class in the rain :(. My hands were slippin and everything was horrible. Anyways, our boat is angled on only one side, and we are making it like that until we find a better option. The challenge day was eggdrop. I teamed with Chris and Rafayel to try and make an egg drop 3 floors without cracking, and we successfully did it using a cardboard box, straws, cotton balls inside, and a huge trashbag parachute.

            This week we actually started to assemble to boats, and I cannot tell you the amount of math I had to do is insane. I had to start writing on the cardboard that we are using so that I wouldn't forget what to do. At this current time, we are preparing for open house. In computer science i got a 4/5 on the mcq portion, and Im super bumbed, but theres nothing that i can do anyways.

            This week we tested out our boat using the water polo pool. But before we did that, this monday we figured out how to angle the front portion of the boat. You see, 3/4's of the boat is just a cube, but in the photos attached below, we wanted to angle out the front end, and the even more math me chris and dhruv had to do is horrid. Afterwards, we decorated the boat and put it in the water. It was able to hold up around 6 bricks, which is like 40 pounds in total..? idk really. This week I also have to redo every single assignment that I missed in this class, computer science, math, and english :D. Good luck to future Noah on AP exams, and happy birthday future!

            This week we started building the walls to the boat. Our game, dar-drats, is very popular amongst the class now, and it is great at deciding who does what for what days. As I'm writing this, I am struggling to find things to talk about, while dhruv and chris do our challenge day from last week. This challenge is rollercoasters. We have to make a marble roll through a "rollercoaster" made out of only paper, and we are allowed to use only tape and scissors to piece it together. We then are graded on a scale of niceness, longest, loops, and if it never stops. Diego looks so confused, Chris is laughing, and Dhruv is talking to jason. I have a video of Dhruv dancing to music, so I will try to post it later today if i can. Good bye!

Chris was working oni the links to the prototype and the final boat tinkercads. And is reallly adorable, and sensual. Here are some photos of our boat. And our boat form aswell.

            This week we completely finished our boat, and did a challenge too! Everything was fine until Wednesday, where me and Dhruv noticed that there was a huge cut in the boat. He thought someone was sabotaging the boat. After reporting it to Mr. Poole, we continued with our new challenge day challenge. We had to create a mechanism that would stop a book from falling over due to external forces. We nailed it until Mr. Poole slapped that shit to outer space, making our contraption disintegrate. Otherwise, I got my braces tightened today, and they hurt like hell, and I’m going out with friends on saturday for his birthday, and monday this girl wanted to meet up with me and get ice cream.
